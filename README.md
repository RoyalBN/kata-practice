# Welcome to my `kata-practice` repository

The main goal of this repository was to practice various Coding Katas in order to improve my skills and adopt the best practices in software development, such as TDD, SOLID Principles, Refactoring, and Clean Code.

Furthermore, I strongly believe that knowledge should be shared. That's why I've made this repository public. By contributing to it, I hope to provide useful insights, share the learning process, and encourage others to participate in the journey of continuous improvement. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, feel free to explore, learn, and share your own perspectives and improvements.

To make it easier for others to follow my thought process, I've structured my commits in small, clear steps. Each commit represents a logical development milestone, making it easier to compare, understand the changes, and follow the evolution of the solution. This way, anyone can dive into the repository and clearly see the progression, improvements, and reasoning behind each step.

Let's grow together, one Kata at a time!
